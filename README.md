# NFTs with On-Chain Metadata - Hardhat and JavaScript

This project demonstrates a basic fully dynamic NFT with on-chain metadata that changes based on your interactions with it, and deploy it on Polygon Mumbai to lower gas fees.

## NfT Properties (IDIANc_bATTLES)

1. ‚öôÔ∏è NFT stored in metadata on chain
2. ‚úâÔ∏è Deployed on Polygon Mumbai
3. üè° Able to modify metadata based on interactions with the NFT

## Steps To Add Polygon Mumbai to your Metamask Wallet

1. ‚öôÔ∏è Navigate to `mumbai.polygonscan.com`and scroll down to the bottom of the page. You'll see the "Add Polygon Network" button, click on it and confirm you want to add it to Metamask
2. ‚õì Getting Test MATIC just navigate to one of the following faucets:  
   -`mumbaifaucet.com` -`faucet.polygon.technology`

## IdiancBattles.sol
Certainly! The provided Solidity code defines a contract called `IdiancBattles`, an ERC721 token (NFT) that includes functionality for creating and managing unique tokens representing characters for battles.


---

Let's break down the code and its functionalities into explanatory statements:

### Contract Initialization and Imports:
- The contract inherits from `ERC721URIStorage` in the OpenZeppelin library, enabling it to implement the ERC721 token standard with URI storage capabilities.
- It imports necessary libraries (`Counters.sol`, `Strings.sol`, `Base64.sol`) for managing token IDs, string manipulation, and Base64 encoding.

### Contract Structure and Data Structures:
- The contract includes a counter `_tokenIds` to manage token IDs and a mapping `tokenIdToLevels` to associate each token ID with its corresponding level.

### Constructor:
- The constructor initializes the contract with a name "Idianc Battles" and a symbol "CBTLS" for the NFT.

### `generateCharacter` Function:
- This function generates an SVG representation for a specific NFT (character) based on its `tokenId`.
- It constructs an SVG string representing the character's visualization using the `abi.encodePacked()` function.
- The SVG includes a black background, text displaying the character type ("Warrior"), and the character's level obtained from `getLevels()`.

### `getLevels` Function:
- This function retrieves the level associated with a specific `tokenId` from the `tokenIdToLevels` mapping and converts it to a string.

### `getTokenURI` Function:
- Generates the token URI for a specific `tokenId`.
- Creates a JSON structure representing the token metadata (name, description, and image).
- The image is constructed by calling `generateCharacter()` to get the SVG representation and encoding it to Base64.

### `mint` Function:
- Increments the `_tokenIds` counter to generate a new `tokenId`.
- Mints a new token (`_safeMint`) for the caller (msg.sender).
- Initializes the level for the new token as 0 and sets its token URI using `getTokenURI()`.

### `train` Function:
- Allows the owner of a token to increment its level.
- Checks if the token exists and verifies that the caller is the token owner.
- Increments the token's level in `tokenIdToLevels` and updates its token URI accordingly.

### Summary:
- The contract enables the minting of unique ERC721 tokens (NFTs) representing characters for battles.
- It provides functionalities to generate character visuals (SVG-based), retrieve token levels, mint new tokens, and increment token levels through training (restricted to token owners).
